Hi instructors, 
While I was trying to run the JUnit tests, I encountered an issue which was from ListExamples.java. According to my understanding from the messages, something in line 42 of the ListExamples.java file caused my test to time out after 500 milliseconds. But what happened there? I tried to figure the bug out but could not. Can you help me with what is happening?
